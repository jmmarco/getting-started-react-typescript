# Getting started React + Typescript

This is a basic TODO app designed to get your feet wet with React and Typescript
There are multiple branches that you can clone so you can practice the concepts covered.

## Getting started

Clone one of the target branches (there are three) and then run `yarn install` or `npm install`

## Available branches

1. `basic-solution`
Contains the basic implementation of the Todo app. You can only toggle todos
2. `add-todo`
Contains the basic plus boilerplate code so you can finish implementing the ability to add a single todo
3. `complete-solution`
Contains the complete implementation of the Todo app. You can toggle and add todos. 


To clone a specific branch use the command:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch NAME-OF-THE-BRANCH https://github.com/jmmarco/getting-started-react-typescript.git
```

## Where do I begin?
You should start with the `basic-solution` branch. Clone it and review. You'll realize that this branch doesn't have the ability to add a todo. It would be nice to have this functionality. 

You can clone the `add-todo` branch listed below or just implement the functionality using the `basic-solution` you already have, your call.

If you get stuck, or would like to see how I implemented the add todo functionality, clone the `complete-solution`.
