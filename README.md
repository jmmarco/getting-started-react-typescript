# Getting started React + Typescript
This is a basic TODO type designed to get your feet wet with React and Typescript
There are multiple branches that you can clone so you can practice the concepts covered. See details below

## Available branches
There are three branches available for you to explore. The branch `basic-solution` has the basic implementation of the Todo app.
Clone this, take a look around and review the Typescript specific stuff.

If you're done reviewing, you'll notice that the basic solution doesn't have the ability to add a todo. 
It would be nice to have this ability. You can clone the `add-todo` branch listed below or just implement the functionality using the `basic-solution` you already have, your call.

If you get stuck, or would like to see how I implemented the add todo functionality, then clone the `complete-solution`. 

### `basic-solution`
This branch contains the basic implementation of the Todo app. You can only toggle todos.
```
git clone --single-branch --branch basic-solution https://github.com/jmmarco/getting-started-react-typescript.git
```

### `add-todo`
Clone the `add-todo` branch. It contains the boilerplate code so you can finish implementing the ability to add a single todo:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch add-todo https://github.com/jmmarco/getting-started-react-typescript.git
```

### `complete-solution`
This branch contais the complete implementation of the Todo app. You can toggle and add todos. 
```
git clone --single-branch --branch complete-solution https://github.com/jmmarco/getting-started-react-typescript.git
```
